# Stage 8G-8I — Clinical reporting completion

Stage 8G-8I completes the production clinical reporting loop after the
Stage 5H assessment/conclusion/report contracts.

- Stage 8G: backend report-package read contract.
- Stage 8H: readiness gate for assessment, conclusion, report, lesion, and
  asset completeness.
- Stage 8I: production report-tab summary in the doctor workspace.

## Scope

- `GET /api/v1/visits/{visitId}/report-package`
- `backend/self-hosted/clinical-report-package-repository.mjs`
- `backend/self-hosted/clinical-report-package-service.mjs`
- `src/lib/self-hosted-clinical-report-package-api.ts`
- `VisitWorkspacePage` production report tab

The report package is a safe, count-oriented readiness snapshot. It includes
statuses, presence booleans, missing gate keys, lesion count, asset count, the
self-hosted product boundary, and a `patientPhotoProtocol` metadata contract
for Batch Q / SD-MF-046.

`patientPhotoProtocol` is not a file-delivery feature. It only states whether
doctor-selected photo/protocol metadata is ready for a future backend contract
and records why patient delivery remains blocked. It exposes photo counts,
consent/readiness blockers, and safe delivery-boundary booleans.

## Runtime boundary

- Managed runtime/database dependency: none
- Source of truth: local PostgreSQL tables
- External CRM/ad/scheduling runtime calls: false
- Browser hardware APIs: false
- Raw patient data in report package: false

The endpoint does not expose object storage paths, signed URLs, access tokens,
raw external payloads, or raw patient identifiers beyond scoped internal ids
already used by the self-hosted API.

For the patient photo/protocol contract specifically, the endpoint also marks:

- raw files exposed: false;
- storage paths exposed: false;
- signed URLs issued: false;
- tokens exposed: false;
- physician text exposed: false;
- release audit required: true;
- revoke required: true;
- patient identity check required: true.

## Readiness gates

The package is `ready` only when:

- assessment exists and is `ready` or `signed`;
- assessment summary is present;
- conclusion exists and is `ready` or `signed`;
- conclusion summary is present;
- report exists and is `signed`;
- report physician text is present;
- report patient-safe text is present.

Otherwise the package is `blocked` and returns stable missing keys such as
`assessment_missing`, `report_not_signed`, or `patient_safe_text_missing`.

## Patient photo/protocol metadata gate

The `patientPhotoProtocol` object uses a separate gate from report readiness.
It is `metadata_ready_backend_blocked` only when:

- imaging consent exists;
- at least one patient photo asset exists (`overview_photo` or `dermoscopy`);
- the report exists and is signed;
- report patient-safe text is present.

Even in that state, `deliveryBoundary.patientDeliveryAllowed` remains `false`
and `self_hosted_photo_delivery_contract_missing` remains in `missing` until a
real self-hosted file proxy, release audit, revoke flow, patient identity gate,
and retention contract are implemented.

If any metadata gate is missing, the object is `blocked` and returns stable
keys such as `imaging_consent_missing`, `patient_photo_assets_missing`,
`report_not_signed`, or `patient_safe_text_missing`.

## Patient photo/protocol release ledger

Batch R adds the first persistence layer for the SD-MF-046 photo/protocol
release workflow:

- migration: `0055_patient_photo_protocol_releases.sql`;
- `POST /api/v1/visits/{visitId}/patient-photo-protocol-release`;
- `POST /api/v1/visits/{visitId}/patient-photo-protocol-release/policy`;
- `POST /api/v1/visits/{visitId}/patient-photo-protocol-release/revoke`;
- `GET /api/v1/visits/{visitId}/patient-photo-protocol-release/audit`;
- `GET /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance`;
- `POST /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance/revoke-expired`;
- `POST /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance/block-missing-expiry`;
- `POST /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance/block-unapproved-retention`;
- `POST /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance/block-unsafe-session-artifacts`;
- repository/service tests for prepare, revoke, RBAC, and protected-field
  hygiene.

This is still not patient photo delivery. The release ledger records
doctor-write prepare/revoke metadata, safe selected-photo counts, blockers,
expiry, and audit actions. It does not expose raw files, storage paths, signed
links, access tokens, or physician-only text. A `prepared` ledger row means the
metadata gate is ready and the only remaining blocker is
`self_hosted_photo_delivery_contract_missing`; patient delivery remains
blocked until a real self-hosted file proxy, identity check, patient portal read
model, retention policy, and approved patient-safe copy gates are implemented.

## Policy governance review

Batch Y adds doctor-side policy governance for the same release ledger:

- `POST /api/v1/visits/{visitId}/patient-photo-protocol-release/policy`;
- payload can update `patientFileProxyEnabled`, `patientCopyApproved`,
  `retentionPolicyApproved`, and `expiresAt`;
- write stays metadata-only: no raw files, storage paths, signed links, tokens,
  object identifiers, or revoke reason text are exposed;
- audit adds `patient_photo_protocol.release.policy_review` and is visible in
  immutable staff/admin release audit counters.

## Staff/admin immutable audit review

Batch W adds a staff/admin read-model for the release ledger:

- `GET /api/v1/visits/{visitId}/patient-photo-protocol-release/audit`;
- repository SQL reads `patient_photo_protocol_releases` plus append-only
  `audit_log` events for prepare, revoke, patient read, proxy download, and
  proxy denial;
- service uses visit read scope, so doctor, clinic admin, and system admin can
  review the safe ledger inside their clinic scope;
- production `VisitWorkspacePage` report tab shows `Журнал выдачи фото` with
  immutable audit counts and event labels.

The audit review is intentionally safe and not a raw audit export. It returns
event labels, timestamps, actor type (`staff` or `patient`), counters, status,
and reason-present booleans. It does not expose raw audit payloads, actor
identifiers, internal request identifiers, revoke reason text, object storage
identifiers, storage paths, signed links, tokens, or physician-only text.

## Staff/admin aggregate governance

Batch AB adds a clinic-scope governance read model for administrator and
private-practice operating screens:

- `GET /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance`;
- production admin route `/admin/governance`;
- UI title: `Управление доступом`;
- aggregate summary for prepared, blocked, revoked, retention, patient-copy,
  file-proxy and expiry gates;
- metadata-only queue rows with queue number, status, policy status, selected
  photo count, blocker count, expiry, update time and attention flags.
- Batch AC extends the same response with aggregate-only `operations` readiness:
  retention review due/ready counts, revoke-review readiness, and patient
  session lifecycle counters. These fields support the admin UI blocks
  `Операционный контур`, `Retention-разбор`, `Отзыв доступа`, and
  `Жизненный цикл сессий`.

The governance read model is not patient delivery and not a patient-level
export. It deliberately omits patient names, raw identifiers, release
identifiers, visit identifiers, report identifiers, revoke reason text, raw
policy payloads, files, storage locations, signed links, tokens, and
doctor-only text. The operations readiness also forces
`temporaryCredentialsExposed`, `qrTokensExposed`, `sessionIdsExposed`, and
`revokeReasonExposed` to false. Its purpose is to make policy/session
lifecycle work visible without weakening the Stage 5N patient portal boundary.

## Production-safe lifecycle execution

Batch AD moves SD-MF-046/045 beyond readiness for one narrow operation:

- `POST /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance/revoke-expired`;
- payload requires `confirm: true` and an optional bounded `limit` from 1 to
  200;
- backend updates only release rows already in `prepared` state with
  `expires_at <= now()` inside the caller clinic scope;
- each affected row is marked `revoked` with a fixed system reason code
  `expired_access_window`;
- the route returns only an aggregate operation result: affected count, active
  windows skipped, expiring windows remaining, missing-expiry count, limit, and
  boundary booleans.

The operation is a production lifecycle control, not a data export. It does
not expose patient rows, raw identifiers, revoke reason text, credentials,
QR tokens, session identifiers, storage paths, signed links, files, or
doctor-only text. Admin UI `/admin/governance` calls it only when a
self-hosted session is configured; demo mode stays local-only.

Batch AE adds the next narrow lifecycle operation:

- `POST /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance/block-missing-expiry`;
- payload requires `confirm: true` and an optional bounded `limit` from 1 to
  200;
- backend updates only release rows already in `prepared` state with no
  `expires_at` inside the caller clinic scope;
- each affected row is marked `blocked` and receives stable blockers
  `expiry_required` and `session_lifecycle_review_required`;
- the route returns the same aggregate-only operation result with safe
  boundary flags.

This closes the unsafe "prepared forever" window without issuing files,
credentials, QR tokens, session identifiers, signed links, or patient-level
exports. Admin UI `/admin/governance` exposes it as `Заблокировать без срока`
inside `Жизненный цикл сессий`; demo mode remains local-only.

Batch AF adds a retention-policy enforcement operation:

- `POST /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance/block-unapproved-retention`;
- payload requires `confirm: true` and an optional bounded `limit` from 1 to
  200;
- backend updates only release rows already in `prepared` state with a future
  `expires_at` and `retentionPolicyApproved=false` inside the caller clinic
  scope;
- each affected row is marked `blocked` and receives stable blockers
  `retention_policy_required` and `retention_review_required`;
- the route returns the same aggregate-only operation result with safe
  boundary flags.

This intentionally does not auto-approve retention policy or extend patient
delivery. Because the secure proxy currently gates downloads on prepared
status, file proxy, consent, and future expiry, the safe operation is to block
active windows missing approved retention policy until a stricter delivery
gate can also verify retention approval at download time. Admin UI
`/admin/governance` exposes it as `Заблокировать без политики` inside
`Разбор хранения`; demo mode remains local-only.

Batch AH adds a credential/QR/session lifecycle safety operation:

- `POST /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance/block-unsafe-session-artifacts`;
- payload requires `confirm: true` and an optional bounded `limit` from 1 to
  200;
- backend updates only release rows already in `prepared` state with a future
  `expires_at` and backend metadata indicating temporary credential, QR, or
  session artifacts need rotation;
- each affected row is marked `blocked` and receives stable blockers
  `credential_rotation_required` and `session_boundary_review_required`;
- the row metadata is patched so issue flags become false and boundary flags
  stay false; backend-only issue timestamp markers are removed;
  temporary credentials, QR tokens, and session identifiers remain hidden;
- the route returns the same aggregate-only operation result with safe
  boundary flags.

This operation is deliberately a blocking control, not credential issuance and
not QR/session delivery. It does not expose patient rows, raw identifiers,
temporary credential values, QR values, session identifiers, revoke reason
text, storage paths, signed links, files, policy payloads, or doctor-only text.
Admin UI `/admin/governance` exposes it as
`Заблокировать артефакты доступа` inside `Жизненный цикл сессий`; demo mode
remains local-only.

### Access artifact rotation preparation

Batch AI adds the next production-safe lifecycle step without issuing access
secrets:

- migration:
  `0056_patient_photo_protocol_access_artifact_rotations.sql`;
- `POST /api/v1/patient-photo-protocol-release/governance/prepare-access-artifact-rotation`;
- payload requires `confirm: true` and an optional bounded `limit` from 1 to
  200;
- backend selects only clinic-scoped release rows already blocked by
  `credential_rotation_required`, `session_boundary_review_required`, or a
  backend-only `credentialBoundaryBlocked` marker;
- backend upserts a metadata-only rotation-preparation ledger row with
  operation `prepare_access_artifact_rotation`;
- release metadata is patched with `accessArtifactRotationPrepared=true`,
  `requiresSecureCredentialStore=true`, and all exposure/delivery boundary
  flags false;
- governance read model now returns aggregate `rotationPending` and
  `rotationPrepared` counters under `operations.sessionLifecycle`.

This is not credential generation, QR generation, session issuance, patient
delivery, or an unblock operation. It deliberately records the production
handoff needed before a secure credential store can be implemented. It does
not expose patient rows, raw identifiers, credential values, QR values,
session identifiers, storage paths, signed links, files, policy payloads, or
doctor-only text. Admin UI `/admin/governance` exposes it as
`Подготовить ротацию доступа` inside `Артефакты доступа`; demo mode remains
local-only.

## Audit

Every read records:

- action: `clinical_report.package.read`
- entity type: `visit`
- metadata: ready flag, missing count, lesion count, asset count,
  patient photo protocol status, patient photo count, and patient photo
  delivery allowed flag

Audit metadata is count-only and safe for logs.

Prepare/revoke operations record separate metadata-only audit events:

- action: `patient_photo_protocol.release.prepare`;
- action: `patient_photo_protocol.release.revoke`;
- metadata: visit id, status, selected-photo count, blocker count, delivery
  allowed flag, and revoke reason presence only.

Audit-review reads record:

- action: `patient_photo_protocol.release_audit.read`;
- entity type: `patient_photo_protocol_release`;
- metadata: visit id, status, immutable-ledger flag, event counts, and protected
  payload exposure flag only.

Aggregate governance reads record:

- action: `patient_photo_protocol.release_governance.read`;
- entity type: `patient_photo_protocol_release_governance`;
- metadata: release totals, prepared/blocked/revoked counts, policy blocker
  counts, active access-window counts, and metadata-only boundary flags.

Production-safe lifecycle operations record:

- action: `patient_photo_protocol.release_governance.revoke_expired`;
- action: `patient_photo_protocol.release_governance.block_missing_expiry`;
- action: `patient_photo_protocol.release_governance.block_unapproved_retention`;
- entity type: `patient_photo_protocol_release_governance_operation`;
- metadata: operation name, execution status, affected/skipped counts, and
  false exposure flags for patient rows, raw identifiers, revoke reason,
  temporary credentials, QR tokens, session identifiers, and delivery.

## Validation

```bash
npm run test:stage8g-8i
npm run check:stage8g-8i
npm run preflight:stage8g-8i
npm run preflight:stage5h
npm run preflight:stage5g
npm run test:project-memory
npm run check:project-memory
node scripts/check-no-deno-locks.mjs
```

Expected:

- backend repository/service/routes tests pass;
- frontend client and workspace tests pass;
- guard confirms product boundary and project-memory markers;
- `package-lock.json` remains unchanged;
- no `deno.lock` files exist.

## Next stage

Stage 8J-8L is a hypothesis until repository files define it. The current
roadmap names it as Device Bridge production hardening.
